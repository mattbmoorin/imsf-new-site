          After a seven-year struggle with a rare form of cancer, Irving Moorin
          died at the age of 48. But the spirit and resolve he showed during
          that time were an inspiration to both his friends and other people
          with whom he came into contact. The Scholarship Fund was started by a
          group of close friends as a memorial to him.
