            Our last fundraiser was a very special one-time performance in
            December 2017. This concert was held to benefit The Irving Moorin
            Scholarship Fund and the B’nai Israel Music Program. Musicians
            included Rabbi Greg Wall (tenor saxophone), Jaimie Baum (flute),
            Brian Marsella (piano), Jay Anderson (bass), and Adam Nussbaum
            (drums). Andres Forero, the drummer for the hit Broadway show
            Hamilton, made a short presentation and conducted a charity auction,
            including two tickets to Hamilton! Click here to read a wonderful
            review of the concert from Jim Motavalli under “Jazz at the
            Synagogue.”
